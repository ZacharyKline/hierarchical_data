Hierarchical_Data project:

v1.0:
Utilized mptt import to be able to create a dropbox like file website which can be easily changed via the admin panel. Reaching index.html will show you all the current "folders" and "files".
This version has the start of the extra credit but does not have the extra credit currently implemented into the code.
